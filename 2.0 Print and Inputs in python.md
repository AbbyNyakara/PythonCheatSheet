## 2.1 Print Function

 The goal of writing code, is to tell a computer what I need it to do and get an output. The way we get to see the output, is by using the print function. 

- Inside the parenthesis, we input what we want it to say: 

```python
print("Hello, world")

Hello, world #This is the output in the console
```

- Notice that inside the print function, it's just not the words that i've added. I've also added some quotation marks around the word. 
- This is my way of telling the computer, that its not code, but some text that I need it to print. This type of data is called a **STRING**. (I'll come to that in upcoming chapters)

## 2.2 Getting user inputs 

Say you're building a program that asks someone his/her name and sends a good morning greeting. How would we do that? 

- You might think of this: 

```python 
print("What is your name? ")
```

- If we run the code, there is no way we can type or get the user to input their name. This is where the input function comes in handy: 

```python
input("What is your name? ")
```
