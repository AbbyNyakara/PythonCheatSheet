## 3.1 Variables

- In the previous chapter, I asked the user his/her name and wanted to give a good morning greeting.

- If I run the code, I am able to get the user input, but there is no way to get the value to refer back to later. In order to do so, I need to store that information the user gives into a VARIABLE called person. Like this: 
 
 ```python
 person = input("What is your name? ")
```
- In this case, I have set the value of person to be what I get from the user.
- And now,  I can print the variable to retrieve what the user typed:  

```python
print(person)
```

### 3.11 variables can be changed. 

- As you can see from the code below, the variable name can be varied. I can reassign different values for that, and that's okay. 

```python
name = "Abby"
print(name)
>>>Abby #Output

name = "Nyakara"
print(name)
>>>Nyakara #Output
```
## 3.2 Variable-Naming Rules

- Like most programming languages, there are rules on how you can name your variables. 

1.  <u>Give descriptive names</u>
- When writing code, make your code as readable as possible. You should come back to your code months later and actually understand what it means.

Here is a badly named variable: 

 ```python
 n = "Ashley"
```

For all you know, Ashley could be a planet,  a pet or a person's name. If you're referring to say a username, then a good variable would look like this: 

```python
username = "Ashley"
```

2. <u>No spaces between variable names. Use underscore to separate words</u>

- In our last example, if you wanted a space between the words, you could have this instead: 

```python
user_name = "Ashley"
```

-  Having a space between the two results in a syntax error: Check below

```python
user name = "Ashley"

>>>user name = "Ashley"
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

3. <u>You cannot start a variable name with a number</u>

- This would be wrong: 
```python
1_weight_unit = "pounds"
```

- This would be okay: 
```python
weight_unit_1 = "pounds"
```

*also, the syntax highlighting should tell you something is wrong
