## 3.1 In-Built data types

- In the previous chapter's print example, the type of data that I passed into the print function is a string. This is one of the many built-in data types in python. Here is a comprehensive list 

> INTEGER 

> FLOAT 

> STRING

> BOOLEAN

> LIST

> TUPLE

> DICTIONARY


## 3.2 Checking the Data Type

- Use the type() function to check the data type.
- For Example

```python
age = 24
print(type(age))

>> <class 'int'> # This shows that it belongs to the integer class


name = "polly"
print(type(name))

>> <class 'str'> #This is a string

```
