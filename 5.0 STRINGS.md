- A string is a sequence of characters / better yet: just text.
- As string is immutable. This means, it cannot be changed/altered. When you perform any functions/operators on the strings, a new string is derived from the original.

There are numerous ways you can create strings: 

1. Using single quote characters
```python
string_one = 'This is a string'
```

2. Using double-quote characters
```python
string_two = "This is also a string"
```

3. Using triple single quote
```python
string_3 = '''This is also a string'''
string_3a= '''
			This is a multiline 
			string 
			'''
```

4. Using triple double quotes
```python
string_4 = """This is also a string"""
string_4a = """
			This is another
			multiline string
			"""
```

*You can use the triple single and double quotes to create multiline strings*

## 5.1  Length of a string

- Use the len() function

```python
string_one = "Abby"
print(len(string_one))
>>> 4

string_two = "Abby nyakara"
print(len(string_two))
>>12
# Note that the space between the words is also counted as a character
```


## 5.2 Indexing and slicing a string

- To obtain an element from a string, you can use indexing. Think of it as finding the position of something. 
- You can index from the front or the back: 

### 5.2.1  Indexing strings

- Finding the first character of a string

```python
name = 'Mary'
print(name[0])

>> M
```

In python and most programming languages, we start counting from 0. This gives us the first character

- Finding the last character:

```python
name = 'Mary'
print(name[-1])

>> y
```

### 5.2.2 Slicing a string

- This is a way to retrieve a series/a range of characters
- Inside the index, give it a range of indexes

```python
city = "Nairobi"
''' 
This will print the characters from the first index, but not including the last index. 
- In this case, it outputs the characters at index 1,2 and 3
'''
print(city[1:4])

>>> air
```


-  When you leave out the first index, the slice starts at index 0

```python
name = "Meyer"
print(name[:4])
>>> Meye

# This is the same as the code below. The one above is just more elegant

name = "Meyer"
print(name[0:4])
>>> Meye
```

- When You leave out the last index, the slice goes to the very end.

```python
# Prints the name from index 1 to the very end
name = "Gabriel"
print(name[1:])

>> abriel
```

> THE THING TO ALWAYS REMEMBER IS, ALWAYS COUNT FROM O. NOT 1.
