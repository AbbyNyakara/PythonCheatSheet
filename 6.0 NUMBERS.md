# 6.0 NUMBERS

- There are various data types that fall under this category: 

> INTEGER

>FLOAT

>COMPLEX NUMBER

## 6.1 Integers 

### 6.1.1 Integer Basics 

- This is a whole number.
- Can be positive or negative
- Does not contain any decimals
- To check whether the variable is of type integer or to convert it to an integer, use int()

```python 
num_1 = 2
num_2 = -125
num_3 = 1239454854

print(type(num_1))
print(type(num_2))
print(type(num_3))

>> <class 'int'>
>> <class 'int'>
>> <class 'int'>
```

- Converting to integer data type:

*the int() method will chop off everything after the decimal*
```python
float_num = 12.56
print(int(float_num))

>> 12
```

### 6.1.2 Arithmetic Operators 
- You can perform mathematical operations on integers. 

1. **+** 
```python
# Addition +
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
print(c)

>> 3
```

2. **-**
```python
# Subtraction
num_1 = 20
num_2 = 5
result = num_1 - num_2
print(result)

>> 15
```

3. * 

```python
#Multiplication
a = 3
b = 4
print(a*b)

>> 12
```

4. **/**

```python
#Division

a = 14
b = 3
print(a/b)

>> 4.0 # Note that this give you a float
```

5. **//**

```python
# Floor Division. This gives you an integer and no decimals
a = 13
b = 2

print(a//b)

>> 6

```

6. **
```python
# Exponentiation
print(2**3)

>> 8
```

7. **%**
```python
# Modulus
#It returns the remainder of dividing the left hand number by the right hand number

print(15%2)

>> 1

# This comes in handy when trying to figure out whether a number os even/odd.
```

## 6.2 Floats 

- This is a negative or a positive number that contains decimals. 
- To convert to a float, use float()
- You can also perform arithmetic operations on floating point numbers like you would integers. 

```python
x = 12.56
print(type(x))

>> <class 'float'>
```

## 6.2.1 Rounding off floats. 

- Use the round() function 

```python
# Rounding off to a whole number
print(round(12.3))
>> 12

print(round(12.56))
>> 13

# To round off to 2 decimal places, pass the number of decimal as the second argument

# The example below rounds off 12.456 to 2 decimal places
print(round(12.456, 2))

>> 12.46
```

### 6.22 Rounding off using the math module. 

- IN LATER CHAPTERS, I WILL DELVE INTO WHAT A MODULE IS AND HOW ITS CREATED
- When you use round(), it only rounds it up or down to the nearest integer. The math module gives you better flexibility, in that, you can specify whether you want to round it up or down. 

```python

# The floor() method that is in the math module rounds it down
import math
print(math.floor(12.99))

>> 12

print(math.ceil(8.02))
>> 9
```
- If we had used round( ) in the examples above, the results would have beed very different. Try it to see. 

## 6.3 Complex Numbers 

- Complex numbers are written with j as the compulsory imaginary part
- You can also perform arithmetic operations on them

```python

num_1 = 2 + 3j
print(num_1)
print(num_1/2)
print(type(num_1))

>>(2+3j)
>>1+1.5j
>><class 'complex'>
```
