## 6.5.1 BMI Calculator
- Create a BMI Calculator that take the name, height in metres and weight in kgs from a user and outputs the body mass index as a number rounded off to a whole number.
- Try it out on your own first: 
- You can search the internet to read about [BMI](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/childrens_BMI_formula.html)

>The goal of this example is to test your understanding of **inputs, data types, variables, arithmetic operations, a few in-built methods, the python print function and f-strings**

```python
# As the user for weight and height:
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
weight = input("Enter your weight in kgs: ")
height = input("Enter your height in meters: ")

# The data from the inputs is of string data type.
# Change the data types.

weight = float(weight)
height = float(height)

# Calculate the body mass index
bmi = weight / (height**2)

#Round off the BMI
bmi_rounded = round(bmi)

#Output the final BMI to the user
print(f"Hello {name.capitalize()}, your BMI is {bmi_rounded}")

```
