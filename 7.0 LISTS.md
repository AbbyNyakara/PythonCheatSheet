## 7.0 LISTS - What is a list

- Now, let me introduce the concept of a python list. A python list is what you'd call a data structure.
- A data structure, is a way of organising and storing data in python. 
- So far, we have looked at ways of storing single pieces of data: That is: using **integers, floats, strings**
- This is how you'd store single data in a variable: This could be a number or a string or a float.
- What you'll also come to realize is: These types of storing single pieces of data are also immutable(Cannot be changed. )

```python
num = 2
name = "Michelle"
weight_kgs = 45.12
```

## 7.1 LISTS SYNTAX

- Storing single pieces of data can work in some cases. However, you might want to store related pieces of data. This can be say the names of the countries in Africa. 
- One way to do it would be: 

```python
country_1 = "Kenya"
country_2 = "Ethiopia"
country_3 = "Somalia"
country_4 = "Nigeria"

# And so on...
```

- As you can already tell, we will end up with 50+ variables of data that is actually related. Python lists give a better format of putting this data into one container. 
- To create a list, you'll have an opening and closing square bracket and the items will be separated by a comma. Like this: 

```python

countries_in_africa = ["Kenya", "Ethiopia", "Somalia", "Nigeria"]
```

- Here, we have created a variable called countries_in_africa and grouped together the countries from our first example. 
- Also, just a by the way, you can also have an empty list: A list of my pets would look like this: (Well, i don't have any üòÅ)

```python
my_pets = []
```
